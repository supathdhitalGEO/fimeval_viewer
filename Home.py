    """
The **accuracy of flood inundation maps** is critical for hydrologic modeling, flood preparedness, and disaster response. However, evaluating different flood maps can be tedious and error-prone.  

**FIMeval** automates this process by:
- Comparing model-predicted FIMs with benchmark datasets
- Computing key evaluation metrics (e.g., CSI, POD, FAR, F1, Accuracy)
- Optionally integrating building footprint impacts
- Supporting permanent waterbody masking and custom AOI boundaries
- Integrated with the extensive benchmark FIM repository developed at SDML which is integrated within the **fimeval**
